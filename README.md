# Project[3]: Inspo

**Link to the website:** [iwishjames.github.io/inspo](https://iwishjames.github.io/inspo-app/#/)

The Problem: Having an app which makes it easy to create high quality posters. I wanted to create a simple app that would also allow me to learn and understand the benefits of using React.

My Solution: A website that does exactly that!

This project was built within 2 days using React and is hosted on It uses GitHub Pages.

The great thing about this website is that it is simple and doesn't require much setup. You could pretty much use any of the stock functionalities available to you via CSS to edit the posters - So the possibilities are large!
